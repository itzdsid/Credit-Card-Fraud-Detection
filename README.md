# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

- The dataset is very large to upload (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- To identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud. In this project, will build & deploy the following two machine learning algorithms:
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Isolation Forest Algorithm
- Using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-scores, we will also investigate why the classification accuracy for these algorithms are misleading.
